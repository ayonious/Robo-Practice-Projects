Integrating Robo here:


Step1: add script `robo` and make it executable `chmod +x robo`
Step2: `robo.yml` file and describe the tasks there
Step3: download binary from here: `https://github.com/tj/robo/releases`
and then put it in `robo-tools` folder
Step4: Run the commands you configured in `robo.yml`

```
